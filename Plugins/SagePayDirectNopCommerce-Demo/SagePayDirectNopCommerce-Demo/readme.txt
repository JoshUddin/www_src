web page: http://nopcommercefactory.com/t/Installation-Guide-v3-2

GETTING UPDATES
As a part of your licence, you will be entitled to free updates for a year.  This includes:
- New versions of nopCommerce that we support
- Any bug fixes
- Updates to existing versions

Upgrades after the initial year will be heavily discounted - approximately 50% off the current price.

As a rule, new features will only be added for the current version of nopCommerce.  We will typically not back
date updates and enhancements.  We will make best endeavours to fix bugs on all versions for the last year, or
longer if we consider the bug particularly severe enough.

Please email us (admin@ninvoice.com) if you require an updated version.
